# Decoding Financial Wellness in Urban India
### An Econometric & Machine Learning Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the determinants of **financial wellness among urban Indian households** using a constructed **Financial Wellness Index (FWI)**.

The study combines:
- Economic theory
- Econometric regression
- Model diagnostics
- Regularized machine learning models

The objective is to understand how **income, expenses, debt burden, and savings behavior** jointly shape household financial wellbeing.

## 📊 Dataset Description
- **Observations:** 20,000 urban households
- **Variables:** 37
- **Key variables:**
  - Financial Wellness Index (FWI)
  - Income & demographics
  - Rent, loan repayment, insurance, consumption expenses
  - Savings ratio, debt burden, rent burden
- No missing values

---

## 🎯 Research Questions
1. How strongly does income influence financial wellness?
2. Do rent and loan repayment reduce financial wellbeing?
3. Does insurance spending improve financial resilience?
4. Is savings behavior more important than income alone?
5. Do regularized models outperform OLS?

## 🧪 Methodology
### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Distribution analysis
- Summary statistics
- Outlier inspection

### 2. Econometric Models
- OLS regression (baseline)
- Block-wise models:
  - Socio-economic
  - Expense burden
  - Savings behavior

### 3. Model Diagnostics
- Multicollinearity (VIF)
- Heteroskedasticity (Breusch–Pagan)
- Autocorrelation (Durbin–Watson)
- Residual normality

### 4. Machine Learning Models
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Elastic Net
- Train-test evaluation using RMSE

## 📈 Key Findings
- Income positively affects financial wellness, but is not sufficient alone
- Rent and loan repayment significantly reduce FWI
- Insurance spending improves financial resilience
- Savings ratio and desired savings percentage are strong predictors
- Elastic Net improves out-of-sample performance

---

## 🧠 Policy & Business Implications
- Promote affordable housing to reduce rent burden
- Encourage automatic savings instruments
- Design financial products focused on protection and discipline
